One of my favourite artists is [Dr. Dre](), his album [2001]() is an all time favourite.  If I were ever to appear on [Desert Island Disc's](), it'd be hard to choose only one song from this album.

But let's take a look at Track 10 from the album: Forget About Dre (Ft. Eminem).  It's a classic you've probably heard a million times before, and if you haven't I do recommend going to have a listen now.

So what can Dr. Dre teach us about content creation and online activism?  Well let's take a look at the below lyrics from the start of verse 3 of the track.

```
If it was up to me, you motherfuckers'd stop
Comin' up to me with your hands out
Lookin' up to me like you want somethin' free
When my last CD was out, you weren't bumpin' me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me
Like it was some disease, but you won't get a crumb from me
```

Like a lot of people, I'm a big fan of [Twitter]() probably slightly addicted to it.  At the start of this week a drama started to unfold, as does happen in certain pockets of Twitter.
